* 1.6.2
- Now Microsoft.mshtml.dll is distributed with the application.

* 1.6.1
- Solved bug adding <a> tags on titles.

* 1.6
- Non western character sets (Cyrillic, chinese, japanese, etc) for CHM files now should work: Cyrilic has been tested and it seems to works. I need feedback about this. Please, say me if it works.
- Added partial support to generate CHM files for languages different than the local system language.
- Path to files of the chmprocessor project now can be stored relative to the location of the project. Thanks to Jozsef Bekes for the patch.
- Added web translations to frech and dutch. Thanks to Luc Van Asch.
- Added field to project to add HTML code into the head tag of the generated web pages (to add google analytics code, for example)
- Added setting to remove / repair broken internal links.
- Tidy.dll (v2003) is no more used. Instead, tidy.exe v2009 is used now. This solves issues fixing html encoded with utf-8. 


* 1.5
- Bug fixed. chmProcessor was not working on 64 bits operating systems due to AnyCPU option. Now the application runs always on 32 bit mode, needed to run Tidy. Thanks to cjervin for the info.
- Multiple Word documents can be joined on a single help.
- Added option /q for Quiet mode (Thanks to Mike Hudgell):
Quiet mode [/q] prevents a window being shown when run with the /g command line and logs messages to stdout/stderr.
- Added option to make the log more or less verbose (Thanks to Mike Hudgell): 
Log Level [/l1, /l2, /l3] lets you choose how much information is output, where /l1 is minimal and /l3 is all the information.
- Added window that shows details when an error happens. List of all errors are now stored on the generation window.
- Bug fixed "Hyperlink images are not included in CHM" (Thanks to Paolo Moretti)
- Bug fixed "If 2 styles "title 1 and 2" follows without text, the conversion is not good."
- Bug fixed. When the source word file had non ASCII characters, images were not well referenced from the CHM file.

* 1.4
- JavaHelp generation.
- Use of Office 2007 Add-in to generate XPS and PDF files.
- Check of broken links inside the document. A "WARNING" text will be written on the generation log for each broken link found.
- Solved bug on web help topic load. Was broken when the topic text had more than one word.

* 1.3
- Google sitemap generation for web help.
- Translation for web static texts.
- Now MS Word styles are not stored into the HTML. They are out, into a common CSS file. This means smaller CHM / web file topics.
- Now you can have different header/footer for CHM help and web help.
- HTML cleaning with Tidy.
- Full text search in web help.
- Added setup with redistributable needed files (no more "Microsoft.mshtml assembly not found" error ).
